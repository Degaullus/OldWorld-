      <h2>Model Profile</h2>
      <p>Each model in Warhammer: the Old World has a profile of nine characteristics:
      </p>
      <p>These are used to describe the various attributes of different models. All characteristics are rated on a scale from 0 to 10 – they cannot go below 0 and only in the rarest of cases will they rise above 10. These characteristics are:
      </p>
      <img src="./pics/profil.png" alt="">
      <h3>Characteristic profile</h3>
      <article class="article">
        <div class="subart">Mouvement (M)</div>
        <p>This shows the number of inches a model can move on the battlefield under normal circumstances. For example, a Man with a Movement of 4 (M4) can move up to 4".
        </p>
        <div class="subart">Weapon Skills (WS)</div>
        <p>This defines how skilled a warrior is with their weapons, or how determined and vicious a monster is.
        </p>
        <div class="subart">Ballistic Skills (BS)</div>
        <p>This shows how accomplished a model is with ranged weapons such as bows or handguns.
        </p>
        <div class="subart">Strengh (S)</div>
        <p>Strength gives a measure of how strong a model is and how easily it can hurt an enemy it has struck in combat.</p>
        <div class="subart">Toughness (T)</div>
        <p>This is a measure of a model’s ability to resist physical damage and pain, and reflects such factors as the resilience of a creature’s flesh and its ability to shrug off injury.
        </p>
        <div class="subart">Wound (W)</div>
        <p>This shows how much damage a model can take before it succumbs to its injuries. Most human-sized models have a single Wound. Large monsters and mighty heroes able to withstand more damage will usually have more Wounds.</p>
        <div class="subart">Initaitive (I)</div>
        <p>This indicates how fast a model can react. In combat, Initiative dictates the order in which models fight.</p>
        <div class="subart">Attacks (A)</div>
        <p>This shows the number of attacks a model makes in combat. Most models have a single Attack. Elite troops, monsters or heroes may be able to strike several times and will usually have more Attacks.</p>
        <div class="subart">Leadership (Ld)</div>
        <p>Leadership shows how courageous, determined and self- controlled a model is. A creature with a low Leadership characteristic is very unruly or cowardly, to say the least!</p>
      </article>
      <article class="article">
        <div class="subart">
          <h3>Split Profile</h3>
          <p>Some models have two or more rows on theirs characteristics profile, often with gaps in each (shown as a dash ‘ - ’). Each row represents a different model, combined together into a single profile. For example, one row might represent a rider, the next their mount. Split profiles are explained in greater detail in the advanced rules.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subart">
          <h3>Characteristic Of Zero</h3>
          <p>If a model has a characteristic of ‘0’, it has no ability whatsoever in what the characteristic represents. This is seen most often with Ballistic Skill, as many models simply lack the ability to make any form of ranged attack.
            If any model or object has a Weapon Skill of 0 then it is unable to defend itself in combat, and any blows struck against it will therefore automatically hit. If at any time a model’s Strength, Toughness or Wounds characteristic is reduced to 0, it is slain and removed from play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subart">
          <h3>Characteristic Tests</h3>
          <p>A model will sometimes be called upon to make a characteristic test. Such a test could be made against any characteristic the model has. For example, a Toughness test is a characteristic test.
            Characteristic Tests
            To make a characteristic test, roll a D6 and compare the result to the relevant characteristic on the model’s profile. If the result is equal to or less than the value of the characteristic, the test is passed. If, however, the result is greater, the test has been failed.
            Where a model (or unit) has more than one value for the same characteristic, use the highest value.</p>
            <h4>automatic pass and fail : </h4>
            <p>When making a characteristic test a natural roll of 6 is always a failure, and a natural 1 is always a success, regardless of any other modifiers. Additionally, if the model has a characteristic of 0 or ‘ - ’ it automatically fails the test.</p>
          <h3>Leadership tests</h3>
          <p>At various times, a model or unit might be called upon to make a Leadership test, or to otherwise test against Leadership in some way.
            To make a Leadership test, roll 2D6. If the result is equal to or less than the model’s Leadership value, then the test has been passed. If the result is greater than the model’s Leadership value, the test has been failed. This will all too often result in the unit fleeing (as described on page 132).
            Whenever Leadership is used, a unit that contains models with different Leadership values will always use the highest – warriors naturally look to the most steadfast of their number for guidance.</p>
            <h4>automatic pass and fail : </h4>
            <p> When making a Leadership test a natural roll of 12 (i.e., rolling a double 6) is always considered to be a fail, regardless of any modifiers that might apply, whereas a natural roll of 2 (i.e., rolling a double 1) is always considered to be a pass.</p>
          <h3>modifying characteristic</h3>
          <p>The rules will often call for a characteristic to be modified. To do this, simply add or substract the modifier(s) shown to the charcateristic, effectively increasing or decreasing the value./</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subart">
          <h3>Other Model Informations</h3>
          <p>IN addition to its profile, a model's rules inclued other information vital to the game. What is varie from model to model, an din many cases not all of the following information will be included for everymodel (not every model can use magic).</p>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Point Value</h5>
          <p>Almost every model will have a points value given within its profile. Points values reflect a model’s worth within its army.
            Most models have a basic points value that increases as various optional items of equipment (weapons, armour, magic items, for example) are added. By adding together the points values of all of the models you have selected, you find the total points value of your army. Knowing this enables players to play evenly matched battles.
            Points values and the rules for building an army are explained in greater detail in the Warhammer Armies section on</p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Troop Type</h5>
          <p>All models have a troop type given as part of their rules. There are five broad categories of troop type: Infantry, Cavalry, Chariots, Monsters and War Machines, each of which is further divided into sub-categories.
            Additionally, some models have the word ‘Character’ in brackets after their troop type. This denotes that the model is a character, one of the brave and powerful heroes that lead an army.
            Troop types and their rules are explained in brief on page 104, and in greater detail in the Advanced Rules. Characters are explained in greater detail in the Characters section on page 202.</p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Base size</h5>
          <p>With very few exceptions, all models used in a game of Warhammer: the Old World should be mounted upon a square or rectangular base, the dimensions of which are given here in millimetres (mm). Sometimes, a range of sizes will be given. In such cases, the base the model is provided with is the correct base to use.</p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Unit Size</h5><p>This tells you how many models of this type form a unit (as described on page 100). Most often, this will be presented as
            a number followed by a ‘+’ symbol, 5+ for example, indicating that a unit made up of this type of model must contain at least five models.
            In some cases, this may be a number range, 5-30 for example, indicating that a unit made up of this type of model must contain at least five models, but no more than thirty. In other cases, most notably in the case of characters, chariots or monsters, this will be presented as a simple number, usually a ‘1’, telling you exactly how many models make up the unit.
            </p></div>
          
          <div class="underart"><h5>Armor Value</h5>
          <p>Most models wear armour, and the type of armour they wear determines their ‘armour value’ (see page 220). However, in the case of large models with multiple riders or crew, such as monsters and chariots, an armour value is not always easy to determine. To avoid confusion, and if appropriate, such models will have an armour value given within their rules.</p></div>
          <div class="nb"><h6>Base size Designer's Note</h6>
          <p>As stated above, all models used in a game of Warhammer: the Old World should be mounted upon a correctly sized and shaped base. However, many players will have in their collections older models, the base sizes of which can vary. Whilst it is possible to play a game of Warhammer: the Old World without needing to re-base such models, in Matched Play events players are required to use correctly based models to ensure all aspects of the game are as fair as possible. To assist with re-basing an existing collection, separate bases are available as part of the Citadel Miniatures range.</p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Equipment</h5>
          <p>Almost all models carry equipment of some sort, from a simple sword or axe to an array of arms and armour. The equipment a model carries will be listed and is factored into its points value. Many models, particularly monsters, will have natural weapons listed as equipment, their claws, teeth and even breath weapons being the weapons they ‘carry’ into battle.
            The rules for many of the weapons and armour carried and worn by models can be found in the ‘Weapons of War’ section on page 212.
            </p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Magic</h5>
          <p>In Warhammer: the Old World, many models represent powerful Wizards, able to bend the Winds of Magic to their will. Whilst not all models are able to wield such powers, those that can have this information within their rules. This details the Lore(s) of Magic they can choose spells from and their ‘Level of Wizardry’.</p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Options</h5>
          <p>Many models have a number of options given. This includes a number of weapons they may be armed with, upgrades to their armour, and so forth. In the case of those models that form units, most have the option to upgrade some of their number to become command models (see page 198).</p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Special Rules</h5>
          <p>In addition to the special rules associated with their troop type, many models have one or more special rules. These fall into three broad categories:
          </p>
          <h4>Universal special rule</h4>
          <p>These are rules that appear in all armies, a full list of these can be found on page 166. If a model has one or more universal special rules, their names will be listed as part of its rules.</p>
          <h4>Army special rules</h4>
          <p>These are special rules unique to the army the model belongs to. If a model has one or more army special rules, their names will be listed as part of
            its rules.
            </p>
          <h4>unique sprecial rules</h4>
          <p>Some models have special rules unique to them. If a model has one or more unique special rules, these will be listed as part of its rules.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Magic Items</h5>
          <p>Some models, notably named characters, are equipped with their own unique magic items. Where this is the case, these items will be described and their rules given along with the model’s.</p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Unique Equipment</h5>
          <p>
            Some models are equipped with items that are unique to them, equipment not found on any other models. In such cases, these items will be described and their rules given along with the model’s.</p></div>

      <h2>Forming Units</h2>
      <article class="article">
        <div class="subart">
          <h4>Formation Types</h4>
          <p>All units must adopt a formation. The type of formation a unit adopts will influence how it acts in battle; how it moves, how it fights, and so on. Each type of formation has its own rules.
            Formation Types
            The type(s) of formation a unit can adopt are indicated by
            a special rule of the same name. Models with more than one such special rule may choose their formation during deployment, and may change it and adopt a different formation by reforming during the game (see page 125).
            Close Order formations are by far the most usual. Therefore, the core ‘how to play’ rules focus upon such units. Examples of more unusual types of formation include ‘Skirmish’ and ‘Open Order’, the rules for which are covered in the advanced rules section. Additionally, some army lists introduce special formation types unique to them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subart">
          <h4>Close Order Formation</h4>
          <p>A unit arrayed in serried ranks is said to be in a "close Order" foramtion. 
            A unit in close order consist of two or more models that are arranged in base contact with each other, edge to edge and front corner to front corner, as show in fig 100.1. 
            All models in such a unit must face the same direction. In addition, the models must be arranged into a formation that consists of one or more horizontal rows called ranks, and
            a number of vertical rows called files (from this formation comes the term ‘rank and file’).
            As far as possible, there must be the same number of models in each rank. Where this is not possible, it must be the rear rank that has fewer models. Once formed into a unit, the models move and fight as a single entity for the entire battle.</p>
            <img src="./pics/fig 100.1.png" alt="">
          <div class="underart"><h5>Unit Shape</h5>
          <p>The shape of a unit in Close Order is also important as such units gain bonuses in certain situations. Based upon this, such units can be said to be in ‘Combat Order’ or in ‘Marching Column’.</p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Combat Order</h5>
          <p>A Close Order formation that is wider than it is deep (i.e., that has more models per rank than per file, as shown in Fig 101.1) or that is square (i.e., has the same number of models per file as per rank) is said to be in Combat Order. Such units are able to count a ‘Rank Bonus’ in certain situations:</p>
          </div>
          <h6>rank bonus</h6>
          <p>If a unit in Close Order formation is wide enough, it can claim a Rank Bonus of +1 for each rank behind the first, up to the maximum determined by its troop type:</p>
          <p class="list">How many models a rank must contain to claim a Rank Bonus, as well as the maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim, is determined by its troop type (see pages 104 and 188).</p>
          <p class="list">Certain special rules may increase the Rank Bonus a unit can claim beyond the maximum normally allowed by its troop type (see page 104).</p>
          <h6>Combat result Bonus</h6>
          <p>Whilst in Combat Order, a Close Order formation may claim a bonus of +1 combat result point (see page 151).
          </p>

          <div class="underart"><h5>Marching Column</h5>
          <p>A unit that is deeper than it is wide (i.e., that has more models per file than per rank, as shown in Fig 101.2) is said to be in Marching Column. A Marching Column cannot claim a Rank Bonus and cannot make a charge move, but may triple its Movement characteristic when Marching (see page 123).</p></div>
          <div class="nb"><h5>Dirupted Units</h5>
          <p>Disruption represents a unit having lost some of its cohesion. A unit becomes Disrupted if:</p></div>
          <p class="list">It is engaged in the flank or rear by an enemy unit with a Unit Strength of five or more.</p>
          <p class="list">It ends its movement with a quarter (25%) or more of its models within difficult terrain or if it is straddling a low linear obstacle.</p>
          <p>A disrupted unit cannot claim a rank bonus</p>
          <img src="./pics/fig 101.1.png" alt="">

    <div class="mainart">
      <h2>Removing Casualties</h2>
      <p class="entete"> Throughout the course of a game, models will suffer ‘wounds’ from enemy attacks (in combat, from shooting, from
        magic spells and so on). Some of these wounds will be saved by a model’s armour, but others will not.
        For each unsaved wound a model suffers, it loses one Wound from its profile. When a model is reduced to zero Wounds, it becomes a casualty and is removed from play.</p>
      <article class="article">
        <div class="subart"><h4>Single Wound Models</h4>
        <p>Most models have only a single Wound on their profile. When this is lost, they are removed from the battlefield as a casualty.</p></div>
        <div class="subart"><h4>Multiple Wound Models</h4>
        <p>Some Models have more than one Wound on their profile. Should a unit of suchs models lose Wounds, you must remove as many whole models as possible. In other words, Wounds are lost the next model, and so on. You cannot spread the loss of Wounds throughout the unit to avoid casualties.</p></div>
        <div class="subart">
          <h4>Removing Casualties From Units</h4>
          <p>When removing casualties, models are always removed from the end of the back rank, either left to right or from right to the left, as the owning player prefers, ensuring where possible that the remaining models are adjacent to one another, as shown in fig 102.1.</p>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Stepping Forward</h5>
          <p>
            Although models are removed from the back of their unit, very often the casualties will have fallen elsewhere, usually in the front or ‘fighting’ rank. Removing models from the back of a unit represents warriors behind the front rank ‘stepping forward’ to fill gaps in the front rank.
            <br>
            However, a model cannot make any form of attack (shooting or combat) during a phase in which it stepped forward. It is too busy clambering over the fallen bodies of its comrades.
            
          </p></div>
          <div class="underart"><h5>Single Rank Units</h5>
          <p>If a unit contains only a single rank, casualties must be removed evenly from either end of the rank.’

      </article>
    </div>
    <div class="mainart">
      <h2>Models & Unit Facing</h2>
      <p class="entete">Most models have a fron, flank and rear arc based on the direction they are facing. The arcs are used to determine what the model can see, and to determine the direction of an enemy charge.</p>
      <article class="article">
        <p>A model’s front, flank and rear arcs extend out from the corners of its base at 45° angles, forming four 90° quadrants, as shown in Fig 103.1 below. A unit’s facings are determined by the facing of its constituent models.</p>
        <img src="./pics/fig 103.1.png" alt="">
        <h3>Line Of Sight</h3>
        <p>You will often need to determine if one model or unit has a line of sight to another. To check a line of sight between models, stoop down to look from the model’s point of view:
        </p>
        <p class="list">If a straight, uninterrupted line can be drawn from within the model’s vision arc to any part of the other model, there isalineofsight.</p>
        <p class="list">If no such line can be drawn to the other model due to intervening terrain, or without crossing over or through another model, there is no line of sight.</p>
        <p> A model is always within its own vision arc and always has a line of sight to itself and its unit. If at least one model in a unit has a line of sight to at least one model from another unit, that unit can ‘see’ the other unit.</p>
        <p><i>Note that models and units always block line of sight. Therefore, it is normally only the models in the front rank of a unit that have a line of sight.</i></p>
        <div class="underart"><h4>Obscured Line Of Sight</h4>
        <p>Line of sight may be partly obscured by terrain features or by other models. In such cases, the other model or unit is said to be ‘in cover’. To check if a model or unit is in cover, stoop down to look from the first model’s point of view:
          <br>
          - If the other model or unit is fully visible, they are not in cover (i.e., they are "in the open"). 
          <br>
          - If up to half of the other model or unit is obscured, they are in partial cover.
          <br>
          - If more than half of the other model or unit is obscured, they are full cover. 
          <br>
        The benefit of partial and full vcover are disscussed in more detail page 139.

    <div class="mainart">
      <h2>Troop Types at a glance</h2>
      <p class="entete">As mentionned previously, all models have a troop type. These, along with the type of formation units of suchs models adopt, determine how the function througout the rules (as well as providing an inside into the role such models fulfil upon the battlefield). Troop types and their rules are explained in greater detail in the advanced rules, on page 188. The following
        pages present some brief but important information needed to better understand the core ‘how to play’ rules that follow. </p>
      <article class="article">
        <h3>Categories Of Troop Types</h3>
        <p>
          There are five main categories of troop type, each of which is further divided into sub-categories. For example, particularly large Infantry fall into the ‘Monstrous Infantry’ sub-category of Infantry. In such cases, when the rules refer to Infantry units, Monstrous Infantry must also follow those rules unless an exception is stated for Monstrous Infantry.
          <br>
          A model's troop type determines the minimu number of such models a rank must contain to claim a Rank Bonus, the mawimum Rank Bonus a unit of such models is able to claim, and the "Unit Strengh" of such a model, as shownn on the page opposite. 
        </p>
        <div class="subart"><h4>Infantry</h4>
        <p>Infantry includes all units of foot troops, be they Goblins, Men, Ogres, Trolls or any other of the myriad Warhammer races fighting on foot. Infantry forms the backbone of most armies and is split into four sub-categories: Regular Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Monstrous Infantry and Swarms.</p></div>
        <div class="subart"><h4>Cavalry</h4>
        <p>The term cavalry refers to any riders mounted on war beasts
          – commonly warhorses or similar creatures. It can also include war beasts on their own as packs of animals which will often function in a manner more similar to cavalry than infantry. Cavalry is split into four sub-categories: Light Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry, Monstrous Cavalry and War Beasts.</p></div>
        <div class="subart"><h4>Charriots</h4>
        <p>A chariot is usually a wheeled war vehicle drawn into battle by beasts of some kind and crewed by warriors, armed to the teeth. This category can also include large objects, such as mobile altars, that are pushed along or carried. Chariots are split into two sub-categories: Light Chariots and
          Heavy Chariots.</p></div>
        <div class="subart"><h4>Monsters</h4><p>Monsters are the largest beings in the Warhammer world, creatures so powerful that they usually roam the battlefield alone. In spite of this, due to their size they function as Close Order units, rather than as Skirmishers. This category includes Dragons, Gryphons and so on. Monsters are split into two sub-categories: Monstrous Creatures and Behemoths.
        </p></div>
        <div class="subart"><h4>War Machines</h4>
        <p>War machines such as cannon and bolt throwers are powerful units on the field of battle, able to pulverise whole regiments, breach stone walls or even slay fearsome monsters with a single, well-placed shot. This is a broad category with varied rules that cover the many different weapons to be found in the Warhammer world, the most commonly seen of which are dealt with in their own section (see page 222).</p></div>

        <h3>Troop Type Table</h3>
        <p>This table summarises the most important information for each troop type. More detail is given in the Advanced Rules section. Referencing this table will help you to better understand some of the rules contained in the core ‘how to play’ rules.</p>
        <img src="./pics/troopTable.png" alt="">
        <p><i>* Note that this is the minimum number required to claim a Rank Bonus. Ranks can contain more or fewer models as you wish, but in order for a rank to count towards Rank Bonus, it must contain at least this many models.</i></p>
        <p><i>**Note that in some cases the maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim can be increased by special rules. The maximum Rank Bonus a unit can claim can also be reduced by its formation, by spell effects, or by terrain.</i></p>
        <div class="subart"><h4>Unit Strengh</h4>
        <p>Sometimes, you may be required to work out the ‘Unit Strength’ of a unit. There are a number of reasons you might need to know this, for example, to determine if one of your units is outnumbered by an enemy. Simply counting the number of models does not account for the sheer power of large and ferocious creatures. Unit Strength represents this well.
          To determine Unit Strength, simply count the number of models currently in the unit and multiply this by the Unit Strength per model as shown on the Troop Type table.</p></div>

      <h2>Magic</h2>
      <p class="entete">The warhammer World is an intrinsically magical place. In battle, magic is a force as real and potent as sword blade, its use limited only by the imagination and skills of the wizard that wields it. Magic can be a subtilt force, infusing allies with strengh and valour, or enemies with frailty and dread. MOre commonly, however, Wizards unshackle the raw power that lies at the heart of magi's chaotic nature, summoning hungry firestorms or devasting bolts of eldtrich power.</p>
      <p>It is therefore only right that magic should form a core part of the game of Warhammer: the Old World as well. Wizards are able to cast spells of different types throughout the turn, and players must protect them accordingly, ensuring they are able to cast the right spell at the right moment, or to thwart the casting attempts of their rivals.
        <br>
        That being the case, explaining how magic works early on is important and the following pages do just that. New players can skip over this section for now if they wish, focusing instead on the more mundane rules and returning to this section once a few games have been played.

          <h3>Wizards</h3>
          <p>Only beings that possess awesome mental might can even hope to bend the powers of magic to their will. Lesser persons would be consumed in an instant, their souls torn apart by terrible energies. In Warhammer: the Old World, all models that can cast spells are known collectively as ‘Wizards’, although specific armies might use other terms. You may see names such as sorcerer, shaman or seer, for example, but all of these and others are considered to be types of Wizard.</p>
          <h4>Levels of Wizardry</h4>
          <p>Naturally, not all Wizards are equal – mastery of magic increases through dedicated practice (and, occasionally, through sheer luck). To represent this, Wizards are divided into four degrees of ability called ‘Levels of Wizardry’ (often shortened simply to ‘Level’ in the rules that follow). The higher a Wizard’s Level, the greater their knowledge of magic:</p>
          <p class="list">
            Level 1: Wizards of the first level are those of humble ability.</p>
          <p class="list">Level 2: Wizards of the second level are experienced spellcasters.</p>
          <p class="list">
            Level 3: Wizards of the third level are great sorcerers of a kind rarely seen.</p>
          <p class="list">Level 4: Wizards of the fourth level are the mightiest of all Wizards, the very equal of crowned monarchs within the realms of sorcery.</p>
          <h4>Lores of magic</h4>
          <p>The Lores of Magic are lists from which Wizards generate their spells. Each Lore of Magic represents a particular approach towards the study and use of magic, giving each its own character reflected by the spells within it. Different Wizards have access to different Lores of Magic.
          <br>
            Accompanying every Wizard’s profile you will find the Lore(s) of Magic they know. In some cases, it will be stated that they know spells from a single, given Lore of Magic, whilst in others it will be stated that they know spells from one of a number
          <br>
            of given Lores of Magic. Where this is the case, you must choose one of these Lores when writing your muster list (see page 276).
            The Lores of Magic most commonly seen in the Old World are presented on page 319.
          </p>
          <h4>spells and generation</h4>
          <p>Players randomly generate spells for each of their Wizards before armies are deployed. If your army contains more than one Wizard, you may generate spells for each in an order of your choosing.
            <br>Each Lore of Magic contains seven spells: six numbered (1-6) and a seventh "signature" spell. To determin the spells your
            Wizard knows, roll a number of D6 equal to their Level of Wizardry, re-rolling any duplicate results. The result(s) show which spell(s) your Wizard knows.
            <br>
            If you wish, your Wizard may then discard one of these randomly generated spells and instead select the signature spell of their chosen Lore of Magic. Any number of Wizards in your army may do this.

        <h4>Spell Categorie</h4>
        <p>Spells fall into six categories. These determine during which phase of the game they can be cast. These are:</p>
        <div class="underart"><h5>Enchantment</h5>
        <p>These spells empower the caster’s allies in some way. Enchantment spells that require a target can only target friendly units. Most often they affect friendly units, but may occasionally have an effect on enemy units. Casting the same Enchantment spell more than once on the same unit during the same turn has no further effect.</p></div>
        <div class="underart"><h5>Hex</h5>
        <p>The opposite of Enchantment spells, weakening the enemy in some way. Hex spells that require a target can only target enemy units. Most often they affect enemy units, but may occasionally have an effect on friendly units. Casting the same Hex spell more than once on the same unit during the same turn has no further effect.</p>
        <p><i>Note that bonuses and penalties from different Hex and Enchantment spells are cumulative, but cannot take any characteristic above 10 or below 1.</i></p></div>
        <div class="underart"><h5>Conveyance</h5>
        <p>These spells enable Wizards to enhance movement or transport units from place to place. Conveyance spells that require a target can only target friendly units. A unit cannot be affected by the same Conveyance spell more than once per turn.</p></div>
        <div class="underart"><h5>Magical Missile</h5>
        <p>These are sorcerous projectiles hurled at the foe. Magic Missiles can only target enemy units and the Wizard must have a line of sight to the target. A successfully cast Magic Missile automatically hits its target; there is no need to make a roll To Hit.</p></div>
        <div class="underart"><h5>Magical Vortex</h5>
        <p> These are roiling globes of magical energy that travel across the battlefield. A Magical Vortex does not require a target – instead, it uses a round template which is placed on the battlefield, not touching the bases of any models, and with its central hole within the range given by the spell. Once placed, Magical Vortexes remain on the battlefield (unless they move off it).</p>
        <p>Some Magical Vortexes move at the start of each turn. If a Magical Vortex ever ends such a move over a unit, continue to move it in the same direction until it can be placed on the battlefield, not touching the bases of any models.</p></div>
        <div class="underart"><h5>Assailment</h5>
        <p>These spells are deadly attacks that strike the
          foe without warning. Assailment spells can only be cast by Wizards that are engaged in combat and can only target enemy units that the caster is engaged in combat with. A successfully cast Assailment spell always hits its target; there is no need to make a roll To Hit.</p>
